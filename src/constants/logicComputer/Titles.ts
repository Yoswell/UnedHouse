        title: "Introduction to PSeInt",
        description: "<span>PSeInt</span> is a tool designed to help students understand computational logic without the complexity of specific programming language syntax. It uses a <span>pseudocode representation</span>, which is a simple and structured way to describe algorithms clearly. By learning to write pseudocode, students can develop an <span>algorithmic mindset</span>, which serves as a strong foundation for later learning more technical programming languages and tackling real-world coding problems."
    },
    {
        title: "Control Structures",
        description: "<span>Control structures</span> are fundamental building blocks of any program, as they manage the flow of execution. These structures allow for decision-making and repetition within a program. The main types include conditionals, which execute actions based on evaluated conditions; loops, which repeat actions until a condition is met or a set number of times; and selectors, which choose actions from multiple options based on the evaluation of an expression."
    },
    {
        title: "Arrays in PSeInt",
        description: "<span>Arrays</span> are a way to store multiple values in a single, organized structure, which simplifies data management and manipulation. Instead of creating multiple variables for each piece of data, arrays allow you to manage lists efficiently. In <span>PSeInt</span>, arrays are declared with a specified size and data type, making them powerful tools for managing large sets of data or performing operations on multiple values simultaneously."
    },
    {
        title: "Functions and Procedures",
        description: "<span>Functions</span> and <span>procedures</span> are used to break a program down into smaller, reusable modules. This modular approach improves the organization of the code, makes it easier to maintain, and reduces redundancy. With functions and procedures, developers can write cleaner code, improve program clarity, and simplify the process of updating and debugging code over time."
    },
    {
        title: "Data Types",
        description: "<span>PSeInt</span> supports a variety of basic data types such as <span>Integer</span>, <span>Real</span>, <span>String</span>, and <span>Boolean</span>. Defining the correct data type for each variable ensures that the program performs accurate calculations, handles data correctly, and avoids errors. Proper data type usage is essential for effective program logic and to ensure that the program works as intended across different situations."
    },
    {
        title: "Input and Output Operations",
        description: "The <span>Read</span> and <span>Write</span> commands handle user interactions in PSeInt. <span>Read</span> is used to capture input from the user, allowing the program to interact with dynamic data. On the other hand, <span>Write</span> is used to display results, messages, or prompts to the user, creating a two-way communication system between the program and the user, which is fundamental for any interactive program."
    },
    {
        title: "Error Handling Basics",
        description: "Basic error prevention involves validating inputs and ensuring that logical conditions are met before processing. This helps prevent unexpected behavior and ensures the program runs smoothly. For example, checking if the userâ€™s input is a valid number before performing mathematical calculations prevents runtime errors and keeps the program running as expected."
    },
    {
        title: "Best Practices in Pseudocode",
        description: "When writing pseudocode, it's essential to use <span>meaningful variable names</span> that clearly indicate their purpose in the program. Adding comments throughout your code helps clarify the logic for others and makes it easier for you to revisit the code in the future. Additionally, maintaining proper indentation and structuring your code into <span>functions</span> or <span>procedures</span> greatly improves readability, making your pseudocode easier to follow and understand."
    },
    {
        title: "Menu Formatting Styles",
        description: "When designing menus in pseudocode, using <span>clear formatting</span> enhances readability and user interaction. Different styles such as <span>boxes, lines, or symbols</span> can help organize options and improve visual structure. Below are several menu designs using <span>hyphens (-), equal signs (=), asterisks (*), and other characters</span> to create structured and intuitive interfaces."

        title: "Recursion on PSeInt",

    {
        title: "Search and Sorting",
        description: "The algorithms of <span>search</span> (as linear or binary search) and <span>sorting</span> (as bubble or selection) are essential for manipulating data in arrays."
    },
    {
        title: "Matrices",

    },
    {
        title: "File Management",
        description: "Although PSeInt does not handle files directly, <span>can simulate read/write operations</span> using arrays or variables to persistently store data."

        title: "Chain Handling",
        description: "The <span>string manipulation</span> includes operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, character lookup, and case conversion."

    {
        title: "Procedures with Parameters",
        description: "The <span>procedures with </span> parameters allow you to modularize your code and reuse complex logic, similar to functions, but without returning values."
